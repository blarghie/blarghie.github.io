<a href="files/marieazcuetaResume.pdf">for marie's resume click here</a> for things you won't find in her resumé read along ...it began with illustrations and animé with the likes of sailor moon, magic knight rayearth, neon genesis evangelion and ghost in the shell, then there's also the uncanny x-men ...then art school...

at uarts marie developed an affinity for turn of the twentieth century typography, such as those of stephane mallarmé's "un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard", guillermo apollinaire's "il pleut", and works by depero and marinetti. she then wrote a paper on visual poetry and had thus influenced her own typography: simple, playful and elegant...  <br /><br /><br /><br />space  <br /><br /><br /><br />white  <br /><br /> <br /><br />space  <br /><br /> <br /><br />... mallarmé had some part in the occult, marie unearthed an interest in another turn of the twentieth century movement, this time in the revival of occultism and ancient knowledge with thanks to a professor, mikhail sergeev. this produced her degree project which aimed to connect the trend of occultist movements (theosophy, symbolism and spiritualism, to name a few) to works of artists such as wb yeats, malevich, kandinsky and klimt. after spending 3 years of print work at school, marie decided that exploring other mediums to further learn and apply design would be the next step towards improvement as an artist and designer. she is currently working with html/ css as well as flash to try out interaction and information design.
