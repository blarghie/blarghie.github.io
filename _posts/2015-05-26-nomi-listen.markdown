Nomiâ€™s Operations Dashboard is where we display data we collect from our cameras and sensors and ingested collections. COOs of specialty retailers and malls use this to be able to get analysis on entrances, displays, store events, store configuration and to optimize opening and closing hours and when to put more associates on the floor based off of historical foot traffic.<br /><br />
