<div class="text-block">
Is an app built on allowing users to subscribe to small businesses' newsletters in turn receiving a reward for making purchase<br /><br />

We designed canned reports specifically to the users who want to easily digest the data we presented. We gave them what we thought they needed: charts of trending days and hours of highest and average traffic over time and the hours in the day where foot traffic was heavier.
