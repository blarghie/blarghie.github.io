<div class="text-block">
The Patch design team collaborated with the AOL central mobile team to create concepts for a mobile app. We knew users wanted a way to get their local news, traffic, gas prices, events first thing int he morning. We've successsfully provided that through a daily newsletter but we wanted our users to engage more with our content and maybe even convert them into content creators. <br /><br />

The goal then was to design an app where users would be able to read and create content from anywhere. We tried various approaches: either we presented the user with content to begin with if they wanted to just browse or various entry points into actions they might take.
