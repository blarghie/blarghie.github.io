<div class="text-block">
Front-end managers at grocery and retail stores needed a dashboard that they can use both while walking around the store and an on-screen version that shows them how many checkout lanes they need to open based off of the line lengths. With another designer we developed &amp; refined an actionable dashboard system to display this data.
