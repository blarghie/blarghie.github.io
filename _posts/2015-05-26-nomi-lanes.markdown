Frontend managers at grocery and retail stores needed a dashboard that they can use while walking around the store and to monitor how many checkout lanes they need to open based on line lengths. These were made available through an overhead screen and a mobile app for portability.<br /><br />
The Lane Management app is the in-store experience for these managers to help them manage service areas. The team designed around various use cases and implementations of the data depending on where the they would be viewing it and how much or little to display to them.
