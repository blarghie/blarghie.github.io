The Listen Grid was my initial attempt to organize the data we collect in a manner that our users would be able to view &amp; manipulate it. After a year, we learned a lot about our users and how they use our product. They needed their associates to be able to analyze the data we collect without spending too much time on it. We then came up with  reports that made the data we have more digestible. <br /><br />

There was a need to be able to surface aggragated data by a collection of floors and being able to easily select those and customizing dates. I designed a dashboard that gave the user what they needed and still allowed them the flexibility of viewing what store or metrics they specifically needed at a given time."><img src="{{ base.url }}/images/Nomi/nomi-redesign-00.png" /></a>

<div class="text-block small">
We designed canned reports specifically for the users who want to easily digest the data we present. We give them what we think they need: charts of trending days and hours of highest and average traffic over time and the hours in the day where foot traffic was heavier. <br /><br />

Additionally, I built an HTML prototype that also served as a demo for the NRF trade show this past January. Let me know if you're interested in seeing that and I'll pass on a url.
