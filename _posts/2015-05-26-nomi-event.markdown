<div class="text-block">
Nomi’s event watching software allows Event Managers to see how effective their campaigns are by showing what percentage of their customers are coming back after an event and if they become loyal customers after that. It also shows what percentage of visitors in the past 30 day attribution period  have come back &amp; have been “reactivated” by an on-going campaign. In addition to this dashboard I also designed a campaign creation experience that walks the user through the setup process.
